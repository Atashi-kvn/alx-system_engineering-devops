2. Share your public key in the file `0-RSA_public_key.pub`.
3. Add the public key to your intranet profile.
4. Keep the private key secure.
5. Optionally, add a passphrase and remember it.

## Task 1: For Best School Loop

**Requirements:**
- Use a for loop to iterate 10 times.
- The script should display "Best School" on each iteration.

## Task 2: While Best School Loop

**Objective:** Create a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using a while loop.

**Requirements:**
- Use a while loop to iterate 10 times.
- The script should display "Best School" on each iteration.

## Task 3: Until Best School Loop

**Objective:** Create a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using an until loop.

**Requirements:**
- Use an until loop to iterate 10 times.
- The script should display "Best School" on each iteration.

## Task 4: If 9, Say Hi!

**Objective:** Create a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times but says "Hi" on the 9th iteration.

**Requirements:**
- Use a while loop to iterate 10 times.
- Use an if statement to display "Hi" on the 9th iteration.

## Task 5: 4 Bad Luck, 8 Is Your Chance

**Objective:** Create a Bash script that displays different messages based on the loop iteration.

**Requirements:**
- Use a while loop to iterate from 1 to 10.
- Display "bad luck" on the 4th iteration, "good luck" on the 8th iteration, and "Best School" for other iterations.
- Use if, elif, and else statements.

## Task 6: Superstitious Numbers

**Objective:** Create a Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 20 with special messages.

**Requirements:**
- Use a while loop to iterate from 1 to 20.
- Display specific messages for the 4th, 9th, and 17th iterations.
- Use the case statement to handle different cases.

## Task 7: Clock

**Objective:** Create a Bash script that displays the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes.

**Requirements:**
- Use a while loop to display hours from 0 to 12 and minutes from 1 to 59.

## Task 8: For ls

**Objective:** Create a Bash script to list files in the current directory with specific formatting.

**Requirements:**
- Use a for loop to list files.
- Display only the part of the file name after the first dash.
- Do not display hidden files.

## Task 9: To File, or Not to File

**Objective:** Create a Bash script to check the existence and attributes of a file.

**Requirements:**
- Use if and else statements (case is forbidden).
- Check if the file exists and print appropriate messages.
- If the file exists, check if it's empty and if it's a regular file.

## Task 10: FizzBuzz

**Objective:** Create a Bash script to display numbers from 1 to 100 with special conditions.

**Requirements:**
- Display "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
- Display "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3.
- Display "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5.
- Otherwise, display the number.
